### A brief history of...this
I searched a long time for the right way and place to store them. Inpired by my Colleague **Kelsey Mok** and her [Fermentation Station](https://github.com/kelseymok/fermentation-station), I decided to use a git repo for it. 
You might think, as a developer, I should've thought about it earlier, but sometimes you cannot see the perfect solution even if its right in front of you.

As I'm still at the very beginning of my recipe repo and adding all my recipes to it, so please be patient :) 
They're coming!
