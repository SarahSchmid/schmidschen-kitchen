### Steps
1. Preheat the Oven => 180 °C (top & bottom heat), 360 °F
1. Mix the Eggs with the sugar, and the vanilla sugar until they're fluffy and light. 
   Combine the eggnog and the oil and stream them slowly into the egg mixture while constantly whisking.
2. Combine the flour and the backing powder, sift them into the bowl with the egg mixture and mix everything together.
3. Grease the cake mold with butter and powder it out with a little flour. Pour the cake batter evenly into the cake mold.
4. Let the cake bake for 50 minutes. When it's done, remove it from the oven and let it rest in the pan for about 10 minutes. 
   Flip it onto a cooling rack and let it rest for 30 minutes. 
5. Mix 100ml Eierlikör with 180g powdered sugar until no lumps remain. Gently brush a first coat of the glaze onto your cake 
   to cover it evenly and let it firm up for 10 minutes. Pour the remaining glaze over the cake and let it firm up again.
